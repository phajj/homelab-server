# homelab-server
Documenting my homelab server build, including parts, guides, and videos.
Plans to:
- Run ProxMox for system virtualization (virtual machines and containers for the following operations)
- Experiment with both TrueNas Scale and Unraid for Network-Attached-Storage backups
- Experiment with both Plex and Jellyfin for DVD media library backup
- Run Pi-Hole for network-wide ad-blocking
- Self-host home security camera system
- Self-host a home automatization system to locally control smart-home devices such as lights and plugs
- Locally host an AI language model and connect it to self-built voice assistant devices built on Raiseberry Pis
